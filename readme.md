## Inspiration
We've been trying to meet deadlines all term - it's finally over, so here's a game to memorialise our experience!

## What it does
You flip gravity using space bar to try to stay on the platforms, and move right to find new objects to boost your score and extend your deadline. But if you hit the distractions, you lose time.

## How we built it
We used [LÃ¶ve](https://love2d.org/) to develop this game.

## Challenges we ran into
Learning Lua quickly and rendering the world were the main challenges.

## Accomplishments that we are proud of
We made it work, we have multiple screens and we made our own art. It also has sound effects.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about programming with Lua.

## What's next for Deadline Dash
We would like to add different levels of difficulty, and maybe custom characters.
